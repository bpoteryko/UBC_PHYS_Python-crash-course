# 1. Learning Python

A great resource for learning Python can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html).

## Using python as a calculator
The easiest thing you can do is use python as a calculator. You can for example write `2+2.5` or `2+10-5*10/2` and hit return on your keyboard to make Python compute the result.

Possible points to discuss:
- Order of operations
- Inequalities
- Modulo operator
- Exponentiation

## Comments
The Python interpreter will skip anything that comes after `#` on a line. You can use this to write notes about what you are doing in your code, which can be useful for human beings to read to understand what is going on. For example
```python
2**6 # is the python notation for exponentiation, ie. 2^6
```

## Assigning variables
You can define variables by setting them equal to something:
```python
a = 1
b = 2
a+b # will now be equivalent to saying 1+2
```

You can update the value a variable contains by setting it equal to something else:
```python
a = 1
a = 2
a # will now be equal to 2, not 1
```

## Strings
You can also set variables to be equal to text. For this to work, you need to surround the text with quotation marks:
```python
a = "this is a string"
b = " and this is another"
a+b #  "this is a string and this is another"
```
Possible points to discuss:
- substrings
- searching in strings

## Lists
initialization and indexing

## `If` statements
It is possible to have parts of code execute only when you want it to. It works like this:

```python
a = 5
if a*3 is 0:
    a = 2

```

Points that can be discussed here:
- Indentation (Python syntax)
- Variable scope

## `While` loops
## `For` loops
## Functions

Possible topics to cover next:
- Classes
- Standard library functions
- Type system - Python weakly typed, but good to be aware of mechanisms
